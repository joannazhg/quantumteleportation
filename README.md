# Quantum Teleportation with Qiskit

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates quantum teleportation using the Qiskit quantum computing framework. The notebook explores the implementation of a quantum teleportation protocol, which allows the transfer of quantum information from one qubit to another over a distance.

## Overview

Quantum teleportation is a fundamental concept in quantum communication and quantum computing. It enables the transmission of quantum information without physically transmitting the quantum state. Instead, it relies on the properties of quantum entanglement and classical communication.

In this notebook, we implement a quantum teleportation protocol using Qiskit. We create a quantum circuit that represents the teleportation process and simulate its execution on a quantum simulator backend. The notebook provides step-by-step explanations of the quantum gates and measurements involved in the teleportation protocol.
